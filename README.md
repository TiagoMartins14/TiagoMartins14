# Hi, I'm Tiago! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
🧠 From Healthcare to Code — with Purpose.
I'm a software developer coming from nursing, driven by a deep curiosity for technology and a enthusiasm for building meaningful systems.

🎯 I've recently finished the core studies at 42 Porto and I've started working on the advanced branches, with special focus on Web3 - a technology capable of reshaping how we interact, build, and trust online.

💡 I'm currently working on a personal project where I use Blockchain technology to create a fair and transparent way to run a lottery-type game where I'm further developing my knowledge day by day.

💼 While my background may seem unconventional, my experience in nursing taught me precision, responsibility, adaptability, and a strong human-centered mindset—all of which I now bring into software.

🚀 I’m actively looking for opportunities where I can deepen my skills and contribute to impactful projects. Let’s connect if you're looking for someone who's as dedicated to learning as they are to delivering.
