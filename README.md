# Hi, I'm Tiago! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
🧠 From Healthcare to Code — with Purpose.
I’m a registered nurse transitioning into the world of software development, driven by a deep curiosity for technology and a passion for building meaningful systems.

🎯 Currently, I’m contributing to an online gaming project where I’ve taken on the challenge of integrating blockchain technology. My focus is on storing tournament data on the Avalanche blockchain using Solidity and Foundry, combining smart contract development with real-world application.

💡 Through this journey, I’ve discovered a genuine enthusiasm for Web3—not just as a technology, but as a movement reshaping how we interact, build, and trust online.

💼 While my background may seem unconventional, my experience in nursing taught me precision, responsibility, adaptability, and a strong human-centered mindset—all of which I now bring into software and blockchain development.

🚀 I’m actively looking for opportunities where I can deepen my Web3 skills and contribute to impactful projects. Let’s connect if you're building in the space or looking for someone who's as dedicated to learning as they are to delivering.
